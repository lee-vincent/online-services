# Note - if you recently applied & tore down your endpoints, and you are trying to re-apply them within 30 days, you might get the following error:

# To reuse this service, please undelete the service following https://cloud.google.com/service-management/create-delete., failedPrecondition

# If this is the case, first undelete the endpoint before re-applying it with Terraform, by running:
# `gcloud endpoints services undelete analytics.endpoints.{GCLOUD_PROJECT_ID}.cloud.goog`
